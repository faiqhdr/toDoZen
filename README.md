Electron Interview Test

# Electron Node Modules Installation
Run `npm install electron`

# Opening ToDoZen App
Run `npm start`

# Note
The `edit task` function is still in development. After the user modifies a task and applies the changes, the user can no longer delete or modify that task. Therefore, further changes are still needed.
